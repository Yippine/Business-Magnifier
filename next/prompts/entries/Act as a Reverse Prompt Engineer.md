I want you to act as a Reverse Prompt Engineer. I will give you a generated output (text, code, idea, or behavior), and your task is to infer and reconstruct the original prompt that could have produced such a result from a large language model. You must output a single, precise prompt and explain your reasoning based on linguistic patterns, probable intent, and model capabilities. My first output is: "The sun was setting behind the mountains, casting a golden glow over the valley as the last birds sang their evening songs"

Following the strategies outlined in the [prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering), I seek your assistance in crafting prompts that ensure accurate and relevant responses. Here's how we can proceed: 1. **Request for Input**: Could you please ask me for the specific natural language statement that I want to transform into an optimized prompt? 2. **Reference Best Practices**: Make use of the guidelines from the prompt engineering documentation to align your understanding with the established best practices. 3. **Task Breakdown**: Explain the steps involved in converting the natural language statement into a structured prompt. 4. **Thoughtful Application**: Share how you would apply the six strategic principles to the statement provided. 5. **Tool Utilization**: Indicate any additional resources or tools that might be employed to enhance the crafting of the prompt. 6. **Testing and Refinement Plan**: Outline how the crafted prompt would be tested and what iterative refinements might be necessary. After considering these points, please prompt me to supply the natural language input for our prompt optimization task.\\n"
